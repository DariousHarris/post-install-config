<p>
The Admin and Agent roles are established. I registered the Admin so new tickets can be created. I'll also create a new
  role : "Supreme Admin", and Department : "System Administrators". Also two new Teams, Level I & II support.

<p>
To get more familiar with the Admin role I created two new Agents, John and Jane Doe. 
  Then created two new customers Karen and Ken for later. Afterwards 3 SLA's are created.
  Sev-A (1 hour, 24/7) Sev-B (4 hours, 24/7) Sev-C (8 hours, business hours)

Then the Help Topics must be created to help organize tickets. 
  I created 4 "Business Critical Outage" "Personal Computer Issues" "Equipment Request" and " Password Reset
